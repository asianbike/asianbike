# 👋 Hi, I'm Luke Son – Aspiring Software Engineer 

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a full-time learner currently building real-world software engineering projects, while preparing for software engineering internships at top tech companies.  
I focus on writing clean, scalable code and exploring how systems work under the hood.
